Hello, everyone! 🌟 Ready to dive into machine learning?

Your task is to create a simple Predictive Model to practice your ML skills! 🤖📊

Task Overview:

1. Dataset:

    📂 Data: Use a basic dataset like the Iris dataset or a simple CSV file with features and labels.
    🧹 Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values and normalizing features if necessary.

2. Model:

    🔍 Model Selection: Choose a basic machine learning model such as Linear Regression or Decision Tree.
    📈 Training: Train your model on the dataset.
    🔍 Evaluation: Evaluate your model using metrics like accuracy or mean squared error.

3. Prediction:

    🔮 Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Optional Features:

    🧩 Visualization: Create visualizations to show how well your model performs (e.g., confusion matrix, feature importance).
    📊 Experiment: Try different models and compare their performance.
    🚀 Deployment: If you’re up for it, deploy your model as a simple web app using tools like Flask or Streamlit.

Note: It fully depends on your skills and how you can elevate it to an advanced-level.
