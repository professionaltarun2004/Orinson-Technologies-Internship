Task-2: Machine Learning Task

Objective: Build a simple Linear Regression model to predict a 
numerical value based on a single feature.

Requirements:

    Use a small dataset with at least two columns (one feature and one target variable).
    Implement Linear Regression using a machine learning library.
    Train and evaluate the model.
    Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot.

Deliverables:

    Python script or Jupyter notebook with the implementation.
    Summary of model performance metrics.
    Plot of the regression line with the data points.
